        <p><span class="first-word"><span class="first-letter">Y</span>ou'll</span> need a long, straight stick and a tape measure.
            Choose a level spot where you can see the entire tree without obstructions.
            Hold the stick vertically in your hand and stand where you can comfortably see the tree.
            Align the bottom of the stick with your eye level. Close one eye to make it easier.
            Back away from the tree while keeping the stick aligned with your eye level. Stop when the top of the stick
            lines up with the top of the tree.
            Use the tape measure to find the distance from where you stand to the base of the tree.
            The measured distance is an estimate of the tree's height.
            This method provides a rough approximation and may not be highly accurate, but it's a simple way to gauge
            the height of a tree without specialized equipment.
