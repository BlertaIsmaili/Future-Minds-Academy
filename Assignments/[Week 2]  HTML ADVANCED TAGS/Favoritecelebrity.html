    <p><b> Coldplay </b> is a <i> British </i> rock group whose melodic piano-driven anthems lifted it to the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century. Coldplay was formed in 1998 at University College, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist <b>Chris Martin</b> and guitarist <b>Jonny Buckland. </b> Coldplay’s full-length debut <b>Parachutes</b> (2000) sold millions on the strength of Martin’s vocals and such singles as the bittersweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY"><i>“Yellow.”</i></a> Parachutes earned the band its first <i>Grammy Award</i> , for best alternative album, and paved the way for the more ambitious <b>A Rush of Blood to the Head</b>(2002). The latter album earned the group two more Grammy Awards, and singles such as <b>“Clocks”</b> helped drive the band’s total album sales over the 20 million mark. Coldplay followed the concert album Live 2003 (2003) with X & Y (2005), a collection of guitar-driven, arena-friendly rock anthems (including the hit single <i>“Speed of Sound”</i>) that elevated the group to the rank of such “big bands” as U2 and Radiohead. Meanwhile, Martin’s 2003–16 marriage to American actress Gwyneth Paltrow earned him celebrity status independent of his musical achievements.</p>
